# Grub-o-meter


Track your grub through the day and everyday bits and bobs such as water intake, whether you've exercises and achievements accomplished. A screen shot will allow you to easily store this diary entry. Easy to clear. Icons when clicked provide a bright tally.

## Reason for build

This project happened because I saw a gym diary in a shop and deemed it to be a tad expensive for only 60 sheets and unusable if you didn't want to spend time rubbing out pencil. Which, let's face it, we just aren't going to do.

I figured it was a nice little project to practise testing in React.
